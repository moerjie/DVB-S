RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 top_i/sigSource_0/inst/alpha1_D_Lookup_Table_out1_reg_0_0 has an input control pin top_i/sigSource_0/inst/alpha1_D_Lookup_Table_out1_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: top_i/sigSource_0/inst/prelookup_idx[13]) which is driven by a register (top_i/sigSource_0/inst/HDL_Counter_out1_reg[17]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.

The RAMB18E1 top_i/RS_0/inst/u_Integer_Input_RS_Encoder_HDL_Optimized/gftablereg10_reg has an input control pin top_i/RS_0/inst/u_Integer_Input_RS_Encoder_HDL_Optimized/gftablereg10_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: top_i/RS_0/inst/u_Integer_Input_RS_Encoder_HDL_Optimized/inputxor[7]) which is driven by a register (top_i/sigSource_0/inst/DATA_IN1_out1_1_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
